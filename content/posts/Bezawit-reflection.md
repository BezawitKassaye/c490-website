### Where I started

Joining this class, I had no prior experience to any of the topics we covered: git, bash scripts, working on the command shell and visiual studio. But now I can confidentally say I know how to get around through these working environments.

### What I learnt

I learnt how to access files and get around my computer from the command line, as well as write a script to do what I want in a more organized way. I learnt how to grant access to excute and read files, which was something that I did not know how to do. In fact I rememeber getting a pdf that I could not open because of its privacy and converting it to a word document just to convert it back to a pdf, in order to have access to it. But now that I know how to do this from the command line, I believe that won't be a problem anymore. 

I also learnt what git is, and will try and use it instead of saving my document multiple times with differnt names just to make sure not to lose the previous version that I worked on.
